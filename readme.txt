Team details:
                  NAME                   USN
               -Kiran v dambal        1KS18CS033
               -Maharaj s             1KS18CS043

Contribution of team members:-

   we have given our best to write the efficent code for a provided question(Asn03P12),
   that is,
	-Kiran,
	  learnt and explained the knapsack algorithum  to team member,wrote and explained the computation 
	  part off the algorithum, helped in applying command line arguments.
	  
	-Maharaj, 
	  came up withe efficent way of sorting, helped in debugging the errors by tracing the algorithum,
	  helped in building the input file and passing the arguments.

Instructions to run the program:-

	We have used command line arguments in this program, for efficent execution off program . And with 
	the halp of command line arguments we can run our program in the CMD just by typing the file name 
	 inputs and capacity saperated by space. 
			
		Eg:-
		     filename	input_file     capacity
		     Asn03P12    input.txt     20

Detils on example invocation and output:-

	This algorithm is greedy implementation of fractional knapsack were profit is maximized
	with minimum no.of items.
	
	 For example  	
               input_file contents:- 60 , 100, 120
				     10, 20, 30
          then
	       output :-
		 
		C:\Users\kiran\Desktop>Asn03P12 input.txt 50
                optimal solution is : 240.000000 	

Challenges faced:-

	-initialy, we were confused between diffrent greedy approaches,
	-wasn't able to compute proper optimal solution due to minute errors,
	-was dificult to understand the passing the file and accessing data through command line arguments.

Things we learnt from our assignment:-

	This assignment helped us to understand the concepts like 
	 -fractional kanpsack algorithm.
	 -diffrent greedy approch for knapsack algortihm.
	 -passing file as input through command line arguments.
	 -multiple sorting im single finction.
	 -Command line argument.
